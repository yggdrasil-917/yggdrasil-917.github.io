      <description>Localization is one of those things many people in game dev talk about but there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a consensus on whether it is valuable to do in your games. For every presentation or post-mortem talking about the benefits of it and how it was key to their success you can find an equal number stating it didn&amp;rsquo;t help. With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure if I will localize all the text in the game I&amp;rsquo;m making but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I did not make a system for localization just in case I do decide to do so.</description>
