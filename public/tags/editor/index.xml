      <description>Shadows Phase Depth Phase PreLighting Phase Lighting Phase ImGui Phase NVidia NSight Preview This post will go over one of the rendering test scenes and we&amp;rsquo;ll see the steps the Tempest engine takes on the GPU to render a frame.

The editor does pretty much the same thing the player does plus a few editor only rendering tasks so the scene we will analyze is actually running in the editor.</description>
