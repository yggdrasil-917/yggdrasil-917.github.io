      <description>The Entity class is the base class in Tempest used for anything that can exist in the scene. This is comparable to the GameObject class in Unity or the Actor class in Unreal. Unlike the GameObject class in Unity however, entities do not require a transform component in order to exist in the scene. The class itself is very simple. All it has is an entity handle and a pointer to the scene that owns the entity.</description>

      <description>Early on in Tempest&amp;rsquo;s development it was decided not to adopt a scripting language and instead use c++, the same language used to make the engine. This more or less goes against the norm these days seeing as how most engines have a scripting language. In fact, you can probably count the number of professional engines that only offer c++ for scripting in one hand. Unreal Engine being by far the most popular one in that category.</description>
